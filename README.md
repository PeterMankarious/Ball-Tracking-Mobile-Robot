# Ball-Tracking-Mobile-Robot

Image processing project that uses python on a jupyter notebook.

The image is processed using different techniques, the main one being hough gradient transform to obtain the location and size of the ball.

The software was developed on a PC and then changed to run on an RPI which is controlled wirelessly by a PC.

Current files are temporary old versions that are acting as place holders until the full project is organized.
